Aim: 
invoke ajaxCall for onkeyup events only after there's a 200ms pause between keypresses.

Approach: 
do it all in JavaScript and post the text to the server via REST.

Demonstation:

sbt> jetty-run 

The home page has a text field, and under the text field is the result of a Wiring-based list 
of the words in your text.  This will currently show List()

Type in "hello world".
Notice the server log shows: Tokenized: List(hello, world)
Notice no change to the wiring, it still shows List()
Refresh the page or hit return, observe the List(hello, world) in the wired field.
